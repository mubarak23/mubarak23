# Hi, I’m Mubarak 👋⚡

I’m a **Bitcoin & Lightning Network developer** focused on building **real-world payment infrastructure**.

I work mainly on **backend systems** that power Lightning payments — handling invoice lifecycles, retries, failures, settlement, and fiat ↔ sats flows. My interests sit at the intersection of **Bitcoin, payments, distributed systems, and open-source software**.
